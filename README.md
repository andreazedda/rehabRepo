# rehabRepo
For this repo the challenge is to control, through a BLE connection with an Android smartphone, a simple object in a Unity project for an Android TV box. 

It would be cool to develop two software:
 - one for the TV box in Unity;
 - one for the smartphone.

The smartphone must read from its own gyroscope and change the position of the object in the Unity project according to the movement that the user want to have for the object in the screen.
